This repository contains a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for viewing Markdown notes as Mind Maps using [Markmap](https://markmap.js.org/). 

A similar plugin is available for [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gera2ld.markmap-vscode).
    
## Features

- Preview your current note as a Mind Map
- Mind Map preview updates as you select other panes, similar to the [Local Graph](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/how-to-open-a-local-graph-view-pane-on-the-right-sidebar/7190), [Outline](https://publish.obsidian.md/help/Plugins/Outline) and [Backlink](https://publish.obsidian.md/help/Plugins/Backlinks) panes

#### Copy screenshot

Places a copy of the Mind Map SVG on your clipboard allowing you to paste it into a note in Obsidian or into an image editor of your choice.

## For developers
Pull requests are both welcome and appreciated. ðŸ˜€

- Use the version of node that matches what is in `.github/workflows/release.yml`. (If using nvm: `nvm install lts/fermium`, `nvm use lts/fermium`).
- Get set up with `npm install --verbose`, and then `npm run dev`.
- Use a test vault with either the `test-vault/` in this repo, or manually install this to another test vault. (You may do so by symlinking, e.g. `ln -s <path to obsidian-mind-map/ <your vault>/.obsidian/plugins/.`, and then symlinking the built artifact to the root git dir `ln -s dist/main.js .`)
- Since Obsidian desktop is an Electron app, you can use the Chromium developer tools to view an in-app console. `Cmd + Opt + I` on macOS or `Ctrl + Shift + I` on Windows/Linux.
